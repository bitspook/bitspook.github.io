Written below are some opinions and rationalizations for them. I have come to
these opinions by interviewing and working with people for years. However
strongly I feel about them, they can still be wrong. If you have feedback for
these, please do contact me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/bitspook&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bitspook&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. All kind of feedback is
very much appreciated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
From &amp;quot;Functional programmer&amp;quot; I mean a programmer familiar with concepts of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming&quot;&gt;functional programming&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A good teammate is someone:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;org-ol&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who takes care of themselves&lt;/b&gt;. They invest in themselves. They care
about their software as a craft, as something more than just cramming
a whole bunch of frameworks and libraries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who take care of their teammates&lt;/b&gt;.

&lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They help their teammates grow, by mentoring and/or by serving as
an example&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are empathetic towards other developers. This is most visible
in kind of code a person writes. An empathetic developer writes
code for other people.

&lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They give preference to readability of code over
micro-optimizations that make them feel clever&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They write modular code with independent modules each of which do
one thing well. And are easily composed to build more complex
functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They write clean, predictable and intuitive APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
FP is steadily gaining popularity, but it is still not popular enough to
breach the talent pool I get to interview from. Familiarity with FP is a
very good indication that the person invest in themselves. And they do
that in a manner which goes beyond just increasing the number of
&amp;quot;frameworks&amp;quot; they have built a Todo App in.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Developer empathy is surprisingly rare. In almost a decade of writing
code, I have met so few developers who really give a fuck that someone
else will also read their abomination. Most software is written in
vacuum. Familiarity with FP don't fix that magically.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
However there is another factor at play here. Ironically, as a
side-effect of FP, code written in a functional manner is often a lot
more readable than its imperative and OOP equivalents (Impromptu quiz:
What's so ironic about this statement?). Not only is functional code
itself naturally declarative, an FP person is more likely to wtf when
they see unreadable code in PR reviews.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Basic principles of FP also make for great advice for inexperienced
developers. Good software architecture is hard to learn, it is a lot
harder to teach. You need a mind capable of holding large amounts of
complex code before the fancy design patterns even start making sense.
In comparison, &amp;quot;pure functions + composition&amp;quot; and you are good to go.
That is it. That is all you need to know to get started with writing
modular, testable, simple code; which is easy to write and easier to
maintain. As a mere side effect of avoiding side effects, you write
naturally &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID&quot;&gt;SOLID&lt;/a&gt; (in spirit)
code.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
FP is not a silver bullet, but looking for functional programmers skew
the universe in your favor a little. You are a lot more likely to get
good people among functional programmers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;patience&quot;&gt;Patience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-patience&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You need to keep it. Don't rush, it's alright if you are not getting it.
Specially if you are from Python world. Javascript is to Python like
India is to New Zeland, things are not actually as complicated as they
appear, you just need to keep little patience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-coffeescript-is-your-friend&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;coffeescript-is-your-friend&quot;&gt;Coffeescript is your friend&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-coffeescript-is-your-friend&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Coffeescript helped me learn to think in javascript more than any book.
I am not saying that you should use coffeescript, but use it for
learning more about javascript. If you are unable to think something in
javascript, do a version of it in Coffeescript, generate javascript and
try to learn. I don't know how good is the generated javascript, but it
was good enough for me to not get stuck. Emacs helped me a lot in this.
I created a buffer with coffee-mode which was not visiting any file, and
compiled coffee to see javascript in a split window for comparison. It
really helped to avoid creating temporary files.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-don-t-rely-too-much-on-books-try-something-real&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;don-t-rely-too-much-on-books-try-something-real&quot;&gt;Don't rely too much on books, try something real&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-don-t-rely-too-much-on-books-try-something-real&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Books can do only so much to help you. Elequent Javascript is great (or
so they call it, actually I never got why it's called great), but what a
real project can teach you is on another level. Go out in wild and try
to do some real project, for fun of course.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-avoid-dom-and-ui&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;avoid-dom-and-ui&quot;&gt;Avoid DOM and UI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-avoid-dom-and-ui&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
DOM manipulation and Javascript have their own concepts which are most
times confusing to foreigners, specially if you are already infected by
JQuery. Make your aim to learn Javascript, as a programming language and
do something you do when learning a new language. Make self-contained
scripts which don't need browser to work. Of course browser help when
you are getting started and with 'console.log' you can avoid all sort of
DOM manipulation, but that's not what I mean. On the next step to
getting started, when you 'think' you know some javascript, try to make
something that involve as little DOM manipulation as possible. Try
making some simple nodeJs module, or some sort of browser extension.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-focus-on-getting-it-done-learning-is-a-bonus&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;focus-on-getting-it-done-learning-is-a-bonus&quot;&gt;Focus on getting it done, learning is a bonus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-focus-on-getting-it-done-learning-is-a-bonus&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's better if you choose to do something you want to use, or at least
something you find really interesting. And focus on getting it done. All
ninja skills you want to learn come as a bonus. Remember those old
Jackie Chan movies in which kung-fu master make him do his household
chores? Just focus on washing clothes, you'll learn iron-fist style
without knowing it, as a bonus.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
