Tech scene in my city (Chandigarh) is daunting. There is super heavy
exploitation of new developers and nobody seem to have any problem
with it. In this post I am plotting the situation from my view, and
sharing the reasons behind my decision of accepting a job where I'll
obviously get exploited.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For a long time, I've been very afraid of doing a job in my locality.
First of my concerns have been that it will hinder my growth. From
people working in local companies, I've heard things like "they will
suck all plasma out of your blood; you'll hate to even look at a
computer". I don't want this to happen with me. I love computers, and I
want to keep loving computers. I don't want to get stuck either. On job,
I'll most likely be doing PHP projects. I don't want to do PHP for rest
of my life. It was the second language I learned, and I hate it. Looking
back at it after a year of Python, most of it look like mumble-jumble of
hoola-boo.
</p>

<p>
I will be working 48 hours a week (excluding break; mon-sat 10 am to 7
pm) for less than $100 per month. Pick that jaw up, I know it's
exploitation. What they are going to do is get projects from oDesk and
similar sites, and make developers do them, and pay like 0.01% to the
devs. I can do it myself sitting at home, I've done a couple projects,
but it was not fun. I got bored and left my third project halfway. I am
so fucking undisciplined that it frustrates even me. Here's the list of
my reasons for diving into the situation which at the moment looks like
a whirlpool to hell.

<h3 id="indiscipline">Indiscipline</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-indiscipline">
<p>
I am sick of my fickleness. I get bored like after 20 minutes of playing
with anything. I've tried as many techniques as I could in 2 years to
discipline myself. I am expecting my new job to discipline me more. I am
expecting it to be one of the most suffocating environments I can
imagine as a developer. I know the culture of most companies in my city.
I'll have to keep my phone outside the office before I enter, only the
time I spend in my cube will be counted as my 'in office' time and
similar. If nothing else, it will at least make me realize the
significance of all the freedom I have in my room.

I want a team of coders to work with. I've always done coding alone, and
I am sick of it. It's no fun. I want to work in a team. I want to show
off my work. And most importantly I want smart people around me to look
upto and learn from. There will probably be senior developers on job
from whom I can learn many things.

I've been living in the place I am staying at present for about 8
months, and my neighbor doesn't know I live in this house. Actually I
met my neighbor in the new company I joined when I went there for
interview. He work there. He accidentally read the address on my resume
and asked me. I wasn't least bit surprised when he said "I didn't know
you live there, I thought there's only an old couple in that house". I
have made literally 0 friends in the period of 8 months, and I hardly
know more than 5 people in whole city (that old couple included). I am
expecting to get to know more people from programming community. And may
be I'll make some friends.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-i-want-these-9-months-to-change-my-life">
<p>
I will be doing a bond of 9 months with them. If I leave them before 9
months, I will be paying them my 2 month salary before leaving. I want
these 9 months to change my life. I don't mind working heavily underpaid
if I can grow myself in same proportions as the exploitation. I will be
working in a technology I've always hated, more because of other's
opinions than my own experience. From this I am expecting to learn
something I haven't realized yet.
</p>

<p>
I want them to stand with a machine gun and shoot whatever they can at
me. I am expecting to gain a lot of mental strength and sharpen my
ability to quickly learn new things further. I've always felt proud of
my quick-learning ability, I want to put it through the most intense
test.

<p>
I know many things. I've developed things in Django, Flask, PyQt,
CodeIgniter, SlimPHP, Wordpress, Angularjs, ReactJs, Backbone and
similar tools. But still I could never collect enough nerve to bid for
any such projects on freelancing sites. I know I can do them, I do them
for my friends or for my experiments, but I get scared when it comes to
work for someone I don't know. On the job I'll be forced to do things.
May be by doing things this way I'll get some confidence.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-i-want-to-study-the-environment">
<p>
This is the last thing on my mind, actually at the moment it is not even
on my mind. I am too scared thinking of what is about to come. But
earlier it was one my reasons for my decision of jumping in.
</p>

<p>
Things are very bad in my city. There is no any kind of active community
of computer enthusiasts; be it some Linux Users Group or something
similar. For me thinking Hackathons in my city is similar to thinking a
Lamborghini in my garage. Developers are heavily underpaid and
over-exploited. I want to study the environment. I have ideas for a
self-sustaining software company that would follow an open business
model (another idea in my ideas.org). I want to foresee if it is
practical.

I have been at home for about 2 months, self-learning stuff. I thought
of continuing like this for next 4 months. Couple days back I met Jayant
on /r/machinelearning. (We've decided to pursue learning ml the way I
discussed in
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140814135355/http://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1y9t11/is%5Fit%5Fa%5Fgood%5Fapproach%5Fto%5Fget%5Fstarted%5Fwith%5Fmachine/">this
thread</a>. If you are interested in joining the team pm me.) I talked to
him and he turned out to be in a situation very similar to mine. He even
called us identical twins. But he's a year ahead of me. He spent a whole
year self-learning without doing any job. He said the experience was
good and he learned a lot. I had a different feeling from his words
though. Assuming that we are identical, I want to know what would have
happened if he made the other choice. So I have decided to go for
"learning on the shitty job" approach, just to make a twist in the
timeline. It's looking like a risky decision to me, so I was postponing
it for some time. But the thrill of doing this experiment is what
triggered me doing it. Life is an experiment after all, and I like doing
crazy things with it.
