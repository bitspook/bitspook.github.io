<h2 id="org51a5646">Problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org51a5646">
<p>
I forget everything I read, as soon as I am done reading (a sentence). Over
time, reading turned from leisure to labor. Pressure of having to remember
things took the fun out of reading. Small attention span and easily getting
distracted made it even worse.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org43762c1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org43762c1">Solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org43762c1">
<p>
Take notes to outsource remembering, and make reading more engaging.
</p>

<p>
Creating well-organized notes take the burden of remembering away. The act of
taking notes keep my attention tethered.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgddab57f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgddab57f">Implementation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgddab57f">
<p>
Note taking process need to be designed to reduce the burden that note-taking
itself can become. Key here is not taking notes, it is crafting a smooth
note-taking workflow.

<h3 id="org8e0b554">Components</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8e0b554">
<p>
My reading workflow involves 3 major components
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Emacs</li>
<li>Denote, an Emacs package for managing notes</li>
<li>Spookfox: An Emacs package for controlling Firefox from Emacs</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org4dafec0" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org4dafec0">Emacs</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4dafec0">
<p>
Emacs is the center stage on which everything else plays. I chose Emacs, because
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It is where I spend most time on my computer</li>
<li>I am very comfortable hacking on it, so tuning things to make my workflow
smoother is an already acquired habit.</li>
<li>I already have a thriving documenting system/workflow in Emacs. I have to
externalize a lot of my mind, for which I've been using Emacs for over a
decade now.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org64a1cb5" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org64a1cb5">Denote</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org64a1cb5">
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote">Denote</a> is my present choice of note-taking Emacs package. It provide structure
to my notes, and thin tooling to navigate this structure. Notes are kept in
<code>&lt;timestamp&gt;-&lt;slug&gt;__&lt;tags&gt;.org</code> format. This makes it easy to find a note by
keywords and tags even from outside Emacs.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgf3f9d8e" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgf3f9d8e">Spookfox</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf3f9d8e">
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/bitspook/spookfox">Spookfox</a> is my answer to "but what about when you need to leave Emacs?".
</p>

<p>
I consume most of the educational content on the web, that usually means
Firefox. I built myself a small system (Spookfox) to make Emacs speak with
Firefox.
</p>

<p>
It is sort of a launch-pad for quickly creating Firefox addons which talk to
Emacs. Most commonly I use it for accessing content I have in browser, e.g
getting information about current browser tab, video being played etc.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf83c717" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf83c717">The workflow</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf83c717">
<p>
It boils down to a single key-combo: <code>C-c n r</code> open a "reading note" in my
scratchpad. <code>C-c n r</code> opens the same note regardless of when I open it; i.e it
don't re-create a new note every time. This is super useful when you are blessed
with the combo of laziness and forgetfulness.
</p>

<p>
Scratchpad is a mechanism for quickly launching an Emacs window for capturing
some information. This usually means bringing an Emacs window to focus with a
keypress.
</p>

<p>
A reading note is a note which has
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><code>reading</code> tag</li>
<li>A <code>source</code> property, which is 95% of the times the web URL (from Firefox)</li>
<li><p>
<code>reading</code> subdirectory in my notes
</p>

<p>
It seems redundant given that there is already a <code>reading</code> tag, but I keep it
not for categorizing the notes but to keep them out of my normal
notes-search.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
My "normal" notes are conceptual, they come from different sources and are
essence of my understanding from different sources. My reading notes <b>are</b> these
sources.
</p>

<p>
"Reading" notes free me up to not worry about the structure of the notes I am
taking or its impact on other notes. After taking the "reading" notes, I review
them and move appropriate parts (or summary/rephrase) them in my "normal"
note(s), while linking back to the reading note.
</p>

<p>
This create a neat web of sources and concepts. I get to be free from the burden
of keeping track of where the knowledge in my notes is coming from. When I need
to track something back to its source, I get nice hand-drafted summary of the
original source.
</p>

<p>
With Spookfox I extend this workflow to (Youtube) videos as well. In addition to
automatically opening the note, I have <a href="https://github.com/bitspook/spookmax.d/blame/7f5f0fbde3777662d2d2fb2baefc18a71c012855/readme.org#L1528-L1610">Emacs configured to insert video
timestamps with my notes</a>. This essentially annotate Youtube videos, and have
come super handy recently in my German language study.
