Written below are some opinions and rationalizations for them. I have come to
these opinions by interviewing and working with people for years. However
strongly I feel about them, they can still be wrong. If you have feedback for
these, please do contact me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bitspook">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/bitspook">Twitter</a>. All kind of feedback is
very much appreciated.

From "Functional programmer" I mean a programmer familiar with concepts of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a>.

<p>
A good teammate is someone:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Who takes care of themselves</b>. They invest in themselves. They care
about their software as a craft, as something more than just cramming
a whole bunch of frameworks and libraries.</li>
<li><b>Who take care of their teammates</b>.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They help their teammates grow, by mentoring and/or by serving as
an example</li>
<li>They are empathetic towards other developers. This is most visible
in kind of code a person writes. An empathetic developer writes
code for other people.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They give preference to readability of code over
micro-optimizations that make them feel clever</li>
<li>They write modular code with independent modules each of which do
one thing well. And are easily composed to build more complex
functionality.</li>
<li>They write clean, predictable and intuitive APIs</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>
FP is steadily gaining popularity, but it is still not popular enough to
breach the talent pool I get to interview from. Familiarity with FP is a
very good indication that the person invest in themselves. And they do
that in a manner which goes beyond just increasing the number of
"frameworks" they have built a Todo App in.
</p>

<p>
Developer empathy is surprisingly rare. In almost a decade of writing
code, I have met so few developers who really give a fuck that someone
else will also read their abomination. Most software is written in
vacuum. Familiarity with FP don't fix that magically.
</p>

<p>
However there is another factor at play here. Ironically, as a
side-effect of FP, code written in a functional manner is often a lot
more readable than its imperative and OOP equivalents (Impromptu quiz:
What's so ironic about this statement?). Not only is functional code
itself naturally declarative, an FP person is more likely to wtf when
they see unreadable code in PR reviews.
</p>

<p>
Basic principles of FP also make for great advice for inexperienced
developers. Good software architecture is hard to learn, it is a lot
harder to teach. You need a mind capable of holding large amounts of
complex code before the fancy design patterns even start making sense.
In comparison, "pure functions + composition" and you are good to go.
That is it. That is all you need to know to get started with writing
modular, testable, simple code; which is easy to write and easier to
maintain. As a mere side effect of avoiding side effects, you write
naturally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">SOLID</a> (in spirit)
code.
</p>

<p>
FP is not a silver bullet, but looking for functional programmers skew
the universe in your favor a little. You are a lot more likely to get
good people among functional programmers.
