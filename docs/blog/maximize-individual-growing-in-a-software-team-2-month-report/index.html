Couple months ago we started an <a href="file:///blog/how-to-maximize-individual-growth-in-a-software-team/">initiative</a> in our team here at <a href="http://trantorinc.com/">Trantor</a> with the
focus on nurturing a culture which optimizes personal growth of an individual in
the team. I believe it is turning out to be quite successful. We decided we'll
focus on 4 things to achieve our goal:

<h2 id="interactive-sessions-of-tools-technologies">Interactive sessions of tools/technologies</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-interactive-sessions-of-tools-technologies">
<p>
This is where we've observed most success. We have had 4 sessions in
past 2 months (we do two-week sprints), with following primary topics:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Up your ops game: Ansible and Vagrant <i>(delivered by <b>Charanjit Singh
(me)</b>)</i></li>
<li>Up your ops game: Docker and Docker Compose <i>(delivered by <b>Charanjit
Singh (me)</b></i></li>
<li>Quick and Dirty Kafka <i>(collaboratively delivered by <b>Charanjit Singh
(me), Rupinder Singh, Sheenam Narula, Krishan Saini</b>)</i></li>
<li>Getting acquainted with Elasticsearch <i>(delivered by <b>Krishan Saini</b>)</i></li>
</ul>

We started off with <code>chai.js</code>, but after probably spending only a few
minutes each, the
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13dko42FS9kcnpqnrjp9QCouQO0vZHDQ0tslID3BAQBs/edit?usp=sharing">google
doc</a> we created for collaboratively creating notes didn't see much
action.

<h2 id="being-active-in-trantor-forums">Being active in Trantor forums</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-being-active-in-trantor-forums">
<p>
Plan was to use Trantor Forums as a platform for proposing
(revolutionary) changes in our project. We started off with
<a href="https://forum.trantorinc.com/t/suggested-improvements-for-tdd-in-veriown-cloud-mutation-testing-and-running-tests-concurrently/74">a
proposal to introduce mutation testing</a> in our test-coverage reports,
but didn't move forward from that.
</p>

<p>
I believe this is because we don't really spend as much time exploring
new/different things/subject-matters to be able to bring more of such
proposals. This problem is one of many that should fix itself if we are
successful in fostering a culture of self growth in the team.

We are yet to realize this dream. Shiva proposed a neat little idea to
solve a problem faced by Trantor employees, but turned out an official
solution was already in the works and about to be released in couple
weeks (it didn't). I believe we should have just gone ahead and spend a
day to build what we wanted, just for the heck of it. That would have
been more fruitful.

Above points are more than just steps to achieve our goal, I believe,
they are also metrics of our success. How much engagement each of these
get reflects on how much of a self-growth culture is prospering in the
team. I wonder if we can somehow quantize these per-person. If nothing
else, that'll create some cool graphs to gawk at.
