I need to reinvent a system for keeping myself in check. I can't think of a
single thing I haven't tried in past; pomodoros, gtd, time boxing, what not.
They all work for some time, and then stop working. We find flaws in systems
pretty quickly; we find cracks, make excused to let us do the easiest thing, the
laziest thing.
</p>

<p>
No matter what system I would adopt next, it all wears off soon. This is a wheel
that has been reinvented countless times. If only world was so simple that what
works for one would work for all. I need to build a system unique for myself;
considering factors that might not have existed for those who predate me. Things
that I didn't include earlier.

<h2 id="change">Change</h2>

<p>
I never considered change to be a part of any of my systems. I should this time.
I believe most things work because of the new tools/techniques/whatever they
bring on plate. A new lifestyle, a new toy, or just a different way to do
something. As soon as the newness fades away, it becomes a chore to do. A
cognitive load that I finally throw away with a deep breath.
</p>

<p>
I wonder how I'll integrate change. To make it an ultimate changing system, may
I should adopt the actual digital nomad lifestyle. Travel around all the time. A
month here, few weeks there, keep hopping from city to city. But then, I don't
think I am a traveler kind of person. I like it more when there is less chaos
outside my mind.

<h2 id="hunger">Hunger</h2>

<p>
Another important thing is the hunger for growth. I have an unquenchable thirst
for growing bigger and bigger. Bigger in everything. I am not a competitive
person though, I don't like competing with others. With just myself. I believe
it is a good thing. Most satisfying is when I grow my skill set, learning
something new or getting deeper into what I am already familiar with. But I
wonder if it should be used as a carrot, or as a central piece of the system.
Using it as carrot would be like having a 2 hour slot to study something after
the day's work is done. For making it a central piece of the system will require
me to find either:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>New things to learn from within what I am currently working. Or</li>
<li>Find work for what I want to learn/strengthen</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-race" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="race">Race</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-race">
<p>
I am seeing people leaving me behind, in the race I don't know I belong
or not. A friend just got a job in a startup with very smart people. I
envy him for the work environment and team he'll have there. May be I'll
start looking for a job in May. Or just enter the wilds of freelancing,
leaving the mothership of faceyspacey. I don't know. But that would be
an easy workaround, not a solution. I might get into a team of people
smarter than me, but not now. Not before I learn to orchestrate this
chaos in my head.
</p>

<p>
These problems have been with me from the very beginning. I thought I
solved them when we were in that pressure cooker with celebvidy. They
seemed to be a thing of past when we were doing 18 hour days a year ago.
But here I am facing them again, half dead. Or living dead may be (the
problems, not me). I know I have nailed them, it just need a final push,
the last piece of puzzle.

I don't like it when I waste a day like I did today. I need to develop a
real good system for myself, a system that will consume least willpower
and provide maximum satisfaction.

It is funny all these things that give most satisfaction at the end of
the day are most hard to do.

<p>
I am making this a blog post. Will be funny to read in future when I
have conquered all these problems.
