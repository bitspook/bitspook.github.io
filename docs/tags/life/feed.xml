&lt;h2 id=&quot;org9f40b28&quot;&gt;Why&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-org9f40b28&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are several reasons I stated in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitspook.in/blog/after-6-months-of-voluntary-unemployment/&quot;&gt;previous blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Other than those,
here are a few more:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;org-ol&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Peer pressure
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At this point it is customary for Punjabis to immigrate to a foreign country.
Since I was little I was conditioned to want to go to a developed country, so
it had become a deep rooted desire. My choice was of &lt;b&gt;which&lt;/b&gt; country, and
going against the advice of almost everyone in my family, I chose to not go
to Canada or Australia. I was promised more money and easier life in those
countries, but I see more of my personal goals in alignment in Germany.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Cold weather
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Punjab has colder weather than most parts of India, and they're my favorite
part of the year. I absolutely abhor Punjab's summers. Germany's cold weather
was appealing.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Europe
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The fact that I get access to more than one country was also a factor. If I
still have the appetite, I can move to a different culture relatively easily.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Rules
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am a sucker for rules. If they are sensible and sensibly implemented, they
can free you up in so many ways. Many lines-of-thought can be short-circuited
and mental resources invested in more interesting things. Germany as far as I
have researched online have more sensible rules, and a culture of mostly
following them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-orga1f5c65&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;orga1f5c65&quot;&gt;How I am feeling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-orga1f5c65&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I am scared shitless. I am full of stress and anxiety, I can barely sleep and
can't focus on anything. I have stopped drinking coffee because I no longer need
caffeine for the jitters.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is way more scarier than what I imagined. When I decided to move to Berlin I
was excited, a little scared too but also looking forward to it. Now I am
fighting myself to not just drop the whole thing every second of the day.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am not an adventurous person, I find all forms of traveling tiresome. I stay
at home to recharge. Fear I am feeling right now however is more than the
ambiguity of going somewhere new. Me burning through my savings during past few
months is also a major contributor. I have made this huge decision, and spent
almost all my remaining funds to book housing, tickets and stuff.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-org86c9ad4&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;org86c9ad4&quot;&gt;What lies ahead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-org86c9ad4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I intend to come back to India after at most 2 years and at least 1 year.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
1 year minimum because 1 year is the limit I am putting for myself to buckle up
and stay in Berlin, experience stuff even if I don't want to. I am hoping it'll
be enough to reveal whether my feeling that being outside my comfort zone will
make me do more fulfilling things is true or not. 2 year maximum because I think
2 years should be enough for personal growth by being in a foreign country.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I find the ideas of e-governance and using technology in public administration
most exciting. I think India is the right place to make most impact with these.
I want to establish a parallel social administration system, which can help the
State's system, or fight it to make a positive impact. This is also one of the
reasons I have decided to go work outside India. Because it is a significant
commitment and I don't want to find myself taking breaks from it for other
things I wanted to do which might significantly disrupt this commitment.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Or all this could just be fantasies. In almost every phase of life, whenever I
felt like things need to be improved I have fantasized about how things could
have been made better. At my home, in school, in college, in software companies,
in my village, in my city, in the companies I worked in; pretty much everywhere.
I have not always taken action, and often moved to the newer set of problems
forgetting the old ones as they became irrelevant to me. I won't fight it if it
happens this time as well. I can't fight every battle, I prefer letting the
fights pick themselves for me. But so far I am fully intent on returning to
India and participate somehow in public administration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

For the last six months, I have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitspook.in/blog/i-have-quit-my-job&quot;&gt;voluntarily unemployed&lt;/a&gt;. Here's a brief
summary of how the last six months shaped my thoughts, and an abstract plan of
what I intend to do next.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-orgb08ea39&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;orgb08ea39&quot;&gt;Mental health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-orgb08ea39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I needed this break a lot more than I thought I did. Being perpetually restless
had been my state of being for too long. It felt good, to breath out.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When writing software, you reach a certain point where things start falling into
place, the uncertainties are answered for and you can feel that the decisions
you made were right. Those few seconds of invincibility spanned over several
(not always consequent) days, because I felt it was me in control. Them I
remember most cherishingly. It was a kind of high I intend to chase again in
life.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Primary reason for which I quit my job was the curiosity about whether I can
manage my ADHD now; or if I still need the crutches of accountability. On job, I
could effortlessly perform well, in contrast to solo freelancing. My therapist
had suggested it will get better with age.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I had more good days than bad, which is a win. Unfortunately I still don't have
a definite answer to consider the matter resolved. More on this later (below).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-org1e3a7ad&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;org1e3a7ad&quot;&gt;Social work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-org1e3a7ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When busy with material responsibilities, I used to fantasize that if I had more
free time I could do so much more for people around me. When I had it, I tried
to start with the place closest to my heart.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I tried to &amp;quot;help&amp;quot; my village by contributing to its small primary school, least
politically charged of situations there. Well, not so much as tried to help as
probed with a long stick to assess the willingness to be helped. I quickly found
out that a significant involvement there is a luxury I can't afford just yet.
Established power structures see everything new as threat, and eagerly sabotage
what they can get away with.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So I chose a different avenue. One just as dear to me, but where I have more
experience and room to maneuver. I decided to make &lt;a href=&quot;https://entropyhacker.space/&quot;&gt;another attempt&lt;/a&gt; to nurture a
healthy tech culture in my city. It produced mixed results because I was not
able to put in as much energy as it demanded.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-org688bd53&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;org688bd53&quot;&gt;Mistake of learning Common Lisp&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-org688bd53&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was running full speed building &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bitspook/press.el&quot;&gt;foolish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bitspook/spookfox&quot;&gt;things&lt;/a&gt;. Then lisp came calling.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;Wile E Coyote hitting the tunnel. Tunnel hits back.&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/videos/hit-it.webm&quot; type=&quot;video/webm&quot;&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bitspook/entropy&quot;&gt;Entropy&lt;/a&gt;, to build a software to help me do the leg work of
building a tech community. Thought came that it is for hackers, so it should be
hackable. Lisp is praised for how hackable it is. It is also praised for its
expressiveness. Momentum is something I was finding hard to achieve with Rust,
because of my inexperience and perhaps the nature of the language and problem I
was trying to solve with it. At least checking lisp out seemed reasonable.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After 30 years of living with them, I have come to recognize desires of pivotal
nature. In the face of these sublimely consuming whims, I can either do what
they say, or not do anything at all (I am told it is common with ADHD, so not to
beat myself too much about it).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've learned that it is possible to suppress these urges by feigning blindness.
My mistake was that of indecision. It is not possible to take a sip and not
gulp. I chose to look at it, but took too long to engage. I got thrown off the
build-mode.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have observed that I operate in two distinct modes: build-mode and study-mode.
Although building something is always a learning experience, and to learn
something I gotta build something; it is efficient to treat them as separate. It
is also easier on my mental peace.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This time, the transition between the two modes was not smooth. Getting
involuntarily thrown out of the workshop left me with (mental) bruises. This
incident is the reason I still consider the matter of my self-discipline
unresolved. Although the fact that there were only 2 such incidents over 6
months is a win by itself (another was when I fell in love with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;, and
spent weeks doing nothing else).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I filled the downtime during transition with another thing I wanted to do, and
probably would not have done otherwise. I traveled.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-orgf8e4ea0&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;orgf8e4ea0&quot;&gt;Travel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-orgf8e4ea0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I am not much of a site-seeing kind of guy. I find traveling exhausting,
regardless of how beautiful the views or how fun the activities. Being a tourist
is not for me. I like to stay and experience. I enjoy exploring/observing people
(people watching?). Witnessing people go by their lives is soothing. There is a
warm fuzzy feeling behind every smile, however mundane.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So I traveled the way I truly like, perhaps for the first time. For about 3
months trotting around the mountains of Uttrakhand, visiting people in their
homes (home stays). Observing a way of life familiar yet strange.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It came as a surprise how eye-opening the experience turned out to be, despite
being quite event-less. It was like learning a new language or studying math. I
could almost feel my brain building new connections. This is one of the few
feelings which still stays exciting even when the rat-race and hoarding have
stopped being as stimulating. I did not expect to find an entirely new source of
it in an experience like this.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is also the easiest methods in terms of active participation, compared to all
the other sources (most are a variations of intellectual exercises; solving a
challenging problem, crafting an elegant solution etc). It does have its costs,
but I believe they do not overlap with those of other methods; so they can be
employed at the same time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I take it to mean I can have twice of what makes me feel most alive, just by
putting myself in a place 🤯
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-org6b8b81b&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;org6b8b81b&quot;&gt;What comes next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-org6b8b81b&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I can perhaps spend a few more months before I run out of savings, but the
dimming safety net has already started making me anxious. I miss the tribe-like
feeling of working in a team, so I am actually looking forward to join work for
that.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Most freeing would be to start a business of my own; not because it will leave
me with more free time, but because I can feel more like myself when working on
something I find meaningful. But that won't be profitable right out of the door,
so perhaps after a bit more grinding I can save up to give myself a chance.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The grind is decided, but I will not choose misery along with. I intend to chase
the feeling of growth and fulfillment. With these constraints, some more
decisions make themselves:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;org-ol&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can't stay at home. Being home is extremely comfortable, but with
comfort comes stagnation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need a job which leaves me with enough time I can invest in something
demanding like math&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need to put myself in a foreign culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Putting these into practice, I have decided I'll move to Berlin for a few years.
The city makes itself a good place to be for me for a few reasons:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practically, it is perhaps the easiest to immigrate to for an individual
Indian citizen, with a job in hand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has a good hacker culture, something I've always wanted to experience but
have only ever read about&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;German culture seem like a great fit for my personal tastes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I get to learn a new language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;German work culture is praised (on the Internet) for respecting boundaries and
giving a priority to life over money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I ever decide to seek higher education (which is likely), German education
policies are good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now that that is decided, what's left to figure out is how to go about it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-org0d1ca57&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;org0d1ca57&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-org0d1ca57&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After 6 months of voluntary unemployment, I am the same man I was before it.
Things I experienced and burdens I unburdened could be achieved by other means
as well. Perhaps I've sown seeds to make me a different person in future, but
they will take time to bloom. It is a guessing game, same as what might have
happened had I done it differently.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As for the journey to be where I already was, I'll do it again if I can.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Several years ago, I decided to quit freelancing and do a day job. The
job would pay much less but I was struggling with mental health (ADHD).
On my therapist's suggestion, I decided to give the job thing a try. It
worked wonderfully, my struggles with discipline are a thing of past. Or
so I believe.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Once again, I have decided to take a drastic step. I have decided to
quit my day job. This is my last week at work, coming Monday I will be
unemployed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I don't have a plan. I haven't planned to leave work permanently. I
don't have an ambition either, world changing or otherwise. This post is
me deciding to take a break from work and finding reasons for doing so,
after the fact.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-curiosity&quot; class=&quot;outline-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;curiosity&quot;&gt;Curiosity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-curiosity&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is exciting. The possibilities are endless. It is scary. Endless
possibilities means a lot of them lead to failure. Odds are stacked in
my favor in some regards; I am good at what I do, world will still need
good software engineers 6 months down the road. They are not so much in
my favor in some regards; precedence says I will fall into inaction and
misery, and achieve nothing. Complete nothing. I've almost always lost
in my struggles with ADHD in past. There is a good chance that I am
deluding myself into believing that this time will be any different.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am curios of whether it is me who has finally tamed the beast, or if I
am going to need the structure a formal job as crutches.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-exhaustion&quot; class=&quot;outline-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;exhaustion&quot;&gt;Exhaustion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-exhaustion&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I am sort of exhausted from making pragmatic decisions all the time.
Building software needs a delicate balance between what makes your
software technically good, and what makes it actually good. Actually
good software solve problems despite its own imperfections.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I want to spend some time making impractical decisions. I want to build
software which solve the problem of making me happy, or at least
entertained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-heartbreak&quot; class=&quot;outline-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;heartbreak&quot;&gt;Heartbreak&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-heartbreak&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I joined my last company because I was sold on an idea. An idea of a
project which was solving a meaningful problem, and was challenging
enough to keep me engaged. I dedicated myself to that, gladly making
many sacrifices in my personal life. I got to build a team and lead it
with autonomy, we built a stolid product (actually, a part of it). And
then I was taken off that project, with what felt like without warning.
I accepted that decision because it was practical for the company.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But I was unprepared for the aftershock. It was traumatizing. With a
snap I was plucked out of one project, and added into another with the
expectation of establishing myself into a similar critical role. The
fact that I did it without a break didn't help. I could no longer find
that sense of belonging anymore, in this new project, or others that
came after.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Perhaps I am not suited for working in a services company with rapid
transitions. Perhaps I set my expectations wrong. Perhaps there was a
lapse in communication. Perhaps, I need to spend some time grieving.
Regardless, I need a break.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-self-growth&quot; class=&quot;outline-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;self-growth&quot;&gt;Self growth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-self-growth&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As good a workplace as Trantor has been, I've been feeling stagnated for
a while. I have learned a lot outside of work, but work has started to
feel like work, which makes me miserable. Overlap between things I want
to learn and things which my job needs have been steadily and
increasingly decreasing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Many of the things I want to learn need dedication which I can't afford
while working full-time as a software engineer. There is no off-switch,
I am always working; even when I am not sitting in front of a computer.
Things I want to learn need me 100% there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-social-work&quot; class=&quot;outline-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;social-work&quot;&gt;Social work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-social-work&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is the most delusional of all the reasons I've cooked up. I imagine
building solutions to problems I see in my surroundings. For some
irrational reason, I feel a desire to give back to society. This is
perhaps narcissism finding its way around my reasoning, coloring itself
righteous. More logical would be to uproot myself and immigrate to a
place where people have already solved the basic problems of human
coexistence.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When I was in school I used to imagine how the school can be reformed,
in college it was the education system, as a freelance developer I
actually started acting on my imaginations and trying to improve my
local tech community. Several times. As an employee, I tried to uplift
my team (and imagined work reform, but never acted on it). Now, I
imagine solutions for many of the problems I see my village face. I am
curious if I will put them into action.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-what-lies-ahead&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-lies-ahead&quot;&gt;What lies ahead?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-what-lies-ahead&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't know. There are too many things. There is a very good chance
that I am going to freeze in the face of choice, be miserable for a few
weeks, and get back to doing a day job. I am going to take time off for
as long as I feel like it, or run out of money. During this time I will
try to learn things and build software that bring me joy. Try to teach
myself how to focus more on the journey.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've observed that many activities (including building software) can be
a meditative experience. If you can let go of the goals, you can quite
enjoy the act. Counter intuitively, the result is often much better. But
it is not always on time, which makes this a dangerous thing to do when
someone else is paying for my work. Perhaps the last bit is because I am
not yet well versed in it. This too might be a matter of finding a
balance. I'll explore.
&lt;/p&gt;

It is near impossible for me to get something done if I don't have 100%
peaked interest in it at &lt;b&gt;this&lt;/b&gt; very moment. Occasionally I can hyper
focus on things, but that hyper focus rarely finish things. Hyper focus
is like eating all the desert, leaving behind a plate full of broccoli.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have noticed however that most of the times when I have actually
finished something, I was, in my mind, helping someone else.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Reviewing the judicious documentation of my life, that is my journal, I
can say it for near about 100% of the things that I actually finished.
The force behind crossing the finishing line was either accountability,
or my belief that someone else is relying on me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
None of my own &amp;quot;side projects&amp;quot; have ever seen a ray of light, but most
things I started for others were finished. Mostly that was
presentations, processes, and very personally tailored learning
materials.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Reviewing my journal, I noticed a pattern developing over the course of
last year. Whenever I had an idea that I wanted to see done, I tried to
frame it in somebody else' canvas. If I could do that, I shared the idea
with the person and got them involved as a partner. Chances of success
I've observed were directly proportional to how much I care for the
person. Some of the things I started that I couldn't fit in to help
someone else are still in &amp;quot;TODO&amp;quot; state, despite the long and clear
road-maps I created for them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This discovery of transforming emotions that come easily to me, into
what I believe I severely lack has sown seeds of new hope. Perhaps I
will be able to replace my need of accountability to get things done
with this. I don't know if it is vain need of acknowledgment, or
goodness of heart, but it works.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have started taking actions to optimize this. I am as anti-social as
they come, and that, now I believe, is a problem to be solved if I want
to increase my happiness.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Most of my activities with other people don't register to my brain as
something it should remember. My mind is often meeting people for first
time despite several previous encounters. That is the first thing I am
going to tackle. Concrete step I am taking for this, is to start using
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/monicahq/monica/&quot;&gt;Monica&lt;/a&gt; to keep track of my
social life. Next step would be to actually start making effort to
socialize. I suppose saying &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot; to my colleagues every morning could
be a good start.
&lt;/p&gt;

I am thinking about doing a small series of posts on how I am managing
the chaos that I am trying to stop fighting. I hope the chaos of an ADHD
mind can be utilized rather than fought against. So far it has been
working out pretty great (for past ~8 months). This post is about how I
manage my ever exploding list of things I want to do.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I believe one of the most important things is to externalize your
thoughts. Making it a habit to write them down is immensely helpful. So
many of my problems stopped being problems as I adopted writing things
down more and more. I have very small working memory. I forget often and
I forget most things. Mind is always thinking of new ideas, things to
do, things to tell people. The knowledge that I am going to forget the
thing I am thinking right now is a big source of anxiety. The burden of
remembering innumerable things and then failing to do so has a cognitive
toll of its own.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I use org-mode as a lot of things; a TODO list is one of them. I am not
going to get into the details of using org-mode for a beginner, but I'll
share my flow of using org mode as a TODO list.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-capturing-things-to-do&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;capturing-things-to-do&quot;&gt;Capturing things to do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-capturing-things-to-do&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A very useful feature of org-mode is how easy it makes to &amp;quot;capture&amp;quot; TOOD
items. I use Emacs as my primary text editor; being a software
developer, most of my day time is spent in Emacs. Any time I think of
something I [want|have] to do, I capture it with 3 keystrokes and
usually immediately refile it under an appropriate heading. I keep 2
TODOs.org files, one for work and one for my personal life.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In my personal TODOs.org file, I keep headings categorizing the kind of
thing it is that I want to do; right now, they are =Study, Personal
Development, Habits, Projects, Reading List, In Basket&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;In Basket&amp;quot;
heading keeps things that are quickly done in a day or few, and/or
cannot be categorized.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My work TODOs.org carries all my work related tasks, including Jira
issues, and general things I want/have to do when I am in the office. I
have a TODO item to integrate org-jira, but right now I am manually
copying Jira task IDs around like an imbecile.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is how my org-capture-templates variable looks like right now:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot; id=&quot;org2af0b8d&quot;&gt;
(setq
   org-capture-templates
   '((&amp;quot;d&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Diary Entry&amp;quot; plain (file+datetree org-agenda-diary-file) &amp;quot;\n&amp;lt;%&amp;lt;%I:%M %p&amp;gt;&amp;gt;\n%?\n&amp;quot;)
     (&amp;quot;f&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Feedback&amp;quot; plain (file+datetree trantor-feedback-file) &amp;quot;\n&amp;lt;%&amp;lt;%I:%M %p&amp;gt;&amp;gt;\n%?\n&amp;quot;)
     (&amp;quot;i&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Idea&amp;quot; entry (file org-ideas-file) &amp;quot;* %?\n%T&amp;quot;)
     (&amp;quot;t&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Todo&amp;quot; entry (file+headline &amp;quot;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Todos&amp;quot;) &amp;quot;* TODO %?\n%U\n[[%F]]&amp;quot;)
     (&amp;quot;c&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Contact&amp;quot; entry (file org-contacts-file) &amp;quot;* %^{Name}\n:PROPERTIES:\n:COMPANY %^{Company}\n:PHONE: %^{Phone}\n:END:&amp;quot;)))
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-delegating-things-to-future&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;delegating-things-to-future&quot;&gt;Delegating things to future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-delegating-things-to-future&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Org-mode has a brilliant feature of scheduling tasks. It's rare for me
to schedule a task for &amp;quot;today&amp;quot;; I delegate stuff to future me. I can
capture and file things in any header, and then use org-mode's agenda
views to filter out things past-me assigned for today. I try to finish
the &amp;quot;today&amp;quot; tasks, and try to stay at peace when I fail to every day.
Org-mode also display a count of for how long I've been missing to do a
certain task which is a handy reminder that I am falling short on my
commitments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-prioritizing-things&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;prioritizing-things&quot;&gt;Prioritizing things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-prioritizing-things&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not all tasks are made equal. Although I try my best to not let my
&amp;quot;Today&amp;quot; tasks list become too big, sometimes there is simply too much on
the plate. In that case, I define priorities for the most important
tasks, which are displayed at the top of the list in Day-agenda view.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-tagging-items&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tagging-items&quot;&gt;Tagging items&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-tagging-items&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I often tag my TODO items so I can easily filter them in the agenda view
when I want to find things I have to do in some particular context. I
often tag things by:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The person's name who I need to be with for doing something e.g when I
want to tell someone something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Scrum sprint in which a task need to get done. For this I don't
tag each task but instead file my tasks in a &amp;quot;Sprint X&amp;quot; heading which
is tagged, and org-mode automatically inherit tags to all the
subheadings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place where I need to be at for doing something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some other task specific metadata that I think can be helpful for
finding this task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-finding-things-to-do&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;finding-things-to-do&quot;&gt;Finding things to do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-finding-things-to-do&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Org-mode allow me to write my todo items in any order in any manner; I
have several files where I write a lot of stuff, some of it is things to
do; most if it isn't. It's crucial to write things down for me, because
I know that I am going to forget it. Org-mode is immensely helpful in
finding things out when I need it. Org-files being just text files allow
me to just grep stuff; which is even more powerful with
helm-projectile-grep. But the killer feature for finding out what I am
supposed to be doing right now is org's agenda view. It allow me to
filter things by time and tags.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Org-mode require you to explicitly add files to a list of
&lt;code&gt;org-agenda-files&lt;/code&gt;. The agenda views only pick tasks from files in this
list. I have almost all my org files in my agenda list. It also provides
different views for the agenda; the one I am using most these days is
the &amp;quot;Day-agenda&amp;quot; view, and Week-agenda view when I want to plan things
ahead for the week.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On my mobile, I use orgzly android app. I am not too happy with it, but
it's the best I've got for now. I've it in my TODO list to create an app
focused on org-mode and TODO lists the way I want it to work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

One of the important aspects of living with ADHD is getting overwhelmed
by thoughts. This is usually a major pain in the ass. When left
unchecked it usually leads to a lot of confusion very painfully visible
to people around you. This made most of my school life very tormenting.
Despite being an &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; student, I was always completely lost.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This got better when I found computers. A book I found while sitting in
the wrong classroom turned things around for me. My thoughts got
channeled, things started becoming a lot more clearer when I wasn't
thinking of 10 random things at a time. I was still thinking of 10
things at a time, but it was now manageable; it was interesting. I
wasn't fighting the trains of thought anymore, I was enjoying the ride.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This was alright while it was fun and games, but it became a problem
again when I entered software development as a profession. Now I had to
focus on things for extended duration of time; which usually was more
than my interest span. It was a struggle again. I got over that period
though; my current solution is to bring more accountability for my work,
for which right now, I am doing a day job.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
During my period of struggle, I did a lot of fight to stay focused. I
fought to not let distractions come in; I blocked sites, tried several
time-boxing techniques; most things worked, but for a small duration of
time. The fight did me more bad than good. Exploring things is what make
me happy, when I took that away from myself, the frustration that built
up as a result threw me in a pit of despair.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My recommendation to anyone finding [her|him]self in my shoes is to not
fight it all the time. Do whatever you feel like every once in a while.
It is very important to keep feeling happy. Trust yourself that you'll
manage to get important things done in time. However, you need to
build/earn this trust. Read my
&lt;a href=&quot;file:///blog/coming-to-terms-with-adhd/&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; for some tips on how I do it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When you find something you feel passionate about, the multiple trains
of thought kinda all go in the same direction. They're all interesting,
and you want to ride them all. If you fight to ride one (or few) of
them, you're gonna give yourself a hard time. Instinct to hop on each
one of them until another one is more interesting isn't all that evil.
I'll be writing more posts on how I do that (i.e tools and techniques I
use), I don't have time right now, and am losing interest in writing
this post. Try to trust yourself that you'll come back to what you're
pausing, have means that allow you to hop b/w different things, and try
to be at peace with the fact that this is simply how you operate. It
might look chaotic to others, you'll still not be &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot;, but you'll
be a whole lot happy, and hopefully satisfied.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In my current setup I have tens of different things I am time-sharing
on, and am still delivering satisfactory value in my work. It is
certainly possible for you to not fight tooth and nail with your way of
thinking and have a satisfactory career (at least in Software
Development).
&lt;/p&gt;

After my recent subscription to &lt;a href=&quot;http://reddit.com/r/adhd&quot;&gt;/r/adhd&lt;/a&gt;, I
realized how important it can be to share experiences. Even when it is
something very personal and seem unlikely that anyone can relate to it,
it can be quite helpful for someone who thinks she's alone with her
struggles. A while back I deleted most of my old blog posts feeling
embarrassed of their suspected cringeworthiness. Now I think it was a
mistake. I am thinking about resurrecting them from archive.org.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In this post I want to talk about how I came to the single instance of
my life when I am not completely lost in self-pity for being too lazy
and undisciplined. Perhaps it was this self-loathing that slowly turned
to depression, and a bad event finally pushed me into the hole that I
believe I am out of now.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I started my research on ADHD when my doctor pointed I might have it. At
that time I was in limbo of a special kind. I was quite used to the
struggle of making myself do work that wasn't interesting anymore. I was
also used to the periods of time when I was simply incapable of doing
any work. But what made me go to the doctor was a relatively longer
period of true nothingness. Nothing would excite me, no matter what I
tried. The chaos inside my head got so out of control I was often
talking to myself in an attempt to materialize the voices and solidify
the line of thought so I could deal with them one at a time. Nothing
worked. I would often contemplate suicide because my mind just wouldn't
shut up about how pathetic I was. It was then I decided to consult help
from a professional.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have not reached a solution, perhaps there is no solution that solves
everything. But here is a list of things that has made a huge impact in
helping me come to terms with my ADHD.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-keep-a-daily-journal&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;keep-a-daily-journal&quot;&gt;Keep a daily journal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-keep-a-daily-journal&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Try to know yourself. Understanding why you are thinking what you are
thinking can be immensely helpful. It will help you figure out the flaws
in your thinking, and how to make up for them. For example, a pat
routine has saved me so many times once I started noticing that how
often in a single I would forget my wallet or my phone or keys. Small
things like this add up to make life miserable, and often go unnoticed
in the storms of thoughts we face every day.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So much of the overwhelmingness can just be let gone by writing it down.
Try to be your own therapist, try to witness yourself. Not to
participate, or engage, just analyze. It can be quite an exhausting
thing to do, but I've found it to be more helpful than meditation. When
I write in my diary, I find myself to be much more in control of life
the next day. It'll also help you figure out which of your ideas are
actually work-able and which are just fluff that need to go in trash
can.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-write-stuff-down&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;write-stuff-down&quot;&gt;Write stuff down&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-write-stuff-down&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You don't need to wait for the night to fall before you can write in
your diary. Writing often during the day is quite helpful too. Write
anything and everything down. Is it something you want to do but can't
right now? Create a todo entry. Just had a brilliant new idea? Capture
it. Invest in a tool that can help you capture your thoughts quickly.
Make this process a part of your life. I use Emacs' Org mode which has a
brilliant capture system, and I am very happy with it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-delegate-to-your-future-self&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;delegate-to-your-future-self&quot;&gt;Delegate to your future self&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-delegate-to-your-future-self&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You don't need to do all the hundred things you have thought of, today
itself. Delegate them to your future self. I don't remember where I
learned it, but it is very helpful to treat your future self as a
different person, and just assign tasks to him that you don't have time
to work on right now. You can schedule stuff you capture right away, or
you can have a weekly review when you sort everything you captured in
the week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-review-weekly&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;review-weekly&quot;&gt;Review weekly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-review-weekly&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is very important to review everything you capture on regular
intervals. It'll give you confidence regarding your system, you could
trust yourself more. When you can start trusting your future self,
things becomes a lot very easier. You also become better at estimating
stuff, so the commitments you give to other people bring you that much
less anxiety.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-respect-the-decisions-made-by-your-past-self&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;respect-the-decisions-made-by-your-past-self&quot;&gt;Respect the decisions made by your past self&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-respect-the-decisions-made-by-your-past-self&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Only way you can trust your future self to finish what's assigned to him
is if you respect the decisions made by your past self. You don't have
to beat yourself up too much about it either. Understand that it's not
easy to estimate things. If we could predict things very reliably, we
could open shops as psychics. Try to achieve &amp;quot;eventual consistency&amp;quot;. Not
everything is equally important. Make sure that if something has been
assigned to you, it eventually gets completed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-find-something-you-can-attach-meaning-to&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;find-something-you-can-attach-meaning-to&quot;&gt;Find something you can attach meaning to&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-find-something-you-can-attach-meaning-to&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's helpful to have something to call home. A principle that you
wouldn't compromise with. I have chosen to attach meaning to the quality
of the work I do. That's where I try to find solace. That's what I use
to bring myself to peace, when I can't control the mess in some parts of
my life. It might be one of the cardinal sins, but this kind of pride
helps build confidence to face life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Romantic relationships are such amazing things. I have had moments in my
life when I considered myself to have a certain level of control on my
mind; in terms of that I can witness myself as an outsider. The
introspection, the self awareness that make me think that, very rarely
accompany me when I am in a relationship. It seem to have a liking to
solitude.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Looking at it from far really brings the picture of a &amp;quot;family man&amp;quot; home.
A lone man seem to have the ability to accomplish much more than a man
bound to another person. It takes a lot of energy just to be with
someone. It has been 220 days since I last wrote a diary entry; my
primary medium of introspection. I've been so lost in the everyday
churn, I chose not to give time to my self. Not that I am complaining;
I've been happily lost.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For however many gifts solitude brings, the pain of loneliness is not
something to fool around with. Perhaps it is the pain itself that make
great people do great things, but it did make me realize the meaning of
crippling in crippling depression. Perhaps this is one of the reasons
successful people credit half their success to their partners. It must
be possible to have partners that can assist each other unlock their
potentials. Can you be so alone with someone? I wonder if it is a matter
of finding someone right, or making yourself right for the one you are
with. I am going to put all my eggs in the latter basket. We'll see how
this gamble plays out.
&lt;/p&gt;

I got an opportunity to introspect in a conversation with a client when
he questioned my use of the word &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot;. What do I mean when I say
something is fun? I am not entirely sure. May be when I see something
that excites me a little. People have very different interpretations of
fun. For me it is usually applying creativity to build something.
Activities the involve combination of these two, make me feel most
satisfied. Balance is very important.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But what do I really mean when I say something is fun? I almost never
know if it is going to be fulfilling at the time of making this
declaration. So how do I reach the point where I can say that X is going
to be fun?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It might be an opportunity to learn something new. The unknown scares me. It's a
thrill and possibly vain feeling of growth. I have a long list of things I want
to learn/master. When my mind sees an opportunity to check a box off of that
list, it gets excited.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It might as well be pure vanity. Vanity plays important part in my mind. When my
subconscious thinks keeping appearances is important, seeing a geeky-sounding
statement just automatically make it blabber &amp;quot;that sounds fun&amp;quot;. Although I try
to keep my narcissism in check, occasional slips are a thing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Another thing that I think I consider fun is &amp;quot;fixing&amp;quot; something. It is quite
possible to mark me as a control freak; although I won't voluntarily accept the
label. I do however occasionally attain rather strong opinions about how certain
things shall be. When I see an opportunity to &amp;quot;fix&amp;quot; something to my definition
of right, that is a strong motivational force. However unreliable it might be,
working with motivation is fun.
&lt;/p&gt;

Life can be so overwhelming sometimes. Sometime I wonder how people go
on about living without asking questions. Or may be they do ask
questions but get satisfied by the answers world has to offer. So much
in the world goes around these questions after all. Religions and
nations for example. Who'd believe in such farcicality if there were
proper answers. Purposelessness is painful. So is loneliness. I seem to
have plenty of both of them. And then there is paranoia and laziness.
Latter two are mostly the reasons for former two. Inability to trust
anyone and jumping to the worst keep me away from most people. Laziness
keep me from diving into anything engaging enough to forget that it's
all meaningless.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Laziness now, may be I can do something about it. I have been practicing
with rituals as of late. They work well 60% of the time, today however I
failed them drastically. May be tomorrow will be a stronger day.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think there is another reason for laziness as well. The work. It gets
so stupid some times. Well, most of the times it is so damn fucking
stupid. It is no fun writing forms all day long. But I need money right
now, I need a lot more than this job provides, but to start generating
more money, I need more skills. Whether I go for a better paying job or
for my own business, both need time. We're building a house, so the need
for money is immediate. I have to stick with this job for long enough to
finish the house and have some savings to give myself some period to lay
back and learn new skills, and bootstrap a business.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As to what business I'll do, I am thinking to have a take on content
publishing and app building combo. I'll build apps that do something,
and I'll start a blog for each app. Apps will have premium versions via
in-app purchases, and blogs will have ads. For this I plan to first
study the competition, for which I'll build an Intenet-wide crawler to
fetch and keep information about everything that goes on in public
Internet.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Another plan I have is to start an app and business for farming.
Bio-farming and whatnot. I like to farm and I like Punjab. I'll like to
do something for the land.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have to get on speed with studying Haskell. I intend to start building
the Internet scanner in Haskell after I finish the 2 Haskell courses I
plan to do. After that I'll do a series of blogs for algorithms, apps,
games and Mathematics. Perhaps on farming and immigration out of India
as well. Basically everything that I want to do, I'll turn it into a
blog.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sometime I want to just hit the road and live a traveler's life. I know
it sound obscene for I hate to travel, but constant change keep me from
falling into limbo, thinking how utterly meaningless everything is. I
guess that's how people go about their lives. There are so many problems
everyone have to deal with, there is no time or energy left to indulge
in this bullshit. Specially given that there is much more juicy bullshit
for most to indulge in; love, family, power, politics, nationality, and
the one bullshit to rule them all, religion.
&lt;/p&gt;
