In this post I am talking about the significance of small things in
life, some lessons I've learned over time, and some random stuff.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Everyday I go to bed with bigger than life dreams, promising myself
tomorrow is the day when I'll take a giant step to drop all my bad
habits and be a better, more productive person forever. A life full of
satisfaction is just a night away. I've been doing this for may be over
2 years. Nothing changed of course. What actually mattered over time
were the small things. All the new year resolutions, or stricter "code
of conduct"s caused exhaustion at best, and dragged me into depression
at their worst.
</p>

<p>
Small things keep accumulating over time, like the little bit of poison
we eat everyday with "food". Many times I'd realize after it's too late,
the little something has gotten so big that I have to cut it off
altogether, or smother under the weight of little mistakes. A little bit
of submission over time can make your employer feel like he own you. A
little bit of lies, can mark you a liar for life.
</p>

<p>
But it's not all bad that come from little things. I have just made
myself such that I see negative first. It is supposed to be a positive
post, but a small step it is.

Winning is a habit. There are many theories that'll nod in affirmation,
I won't mention in this post. You have to get into the habit of winning
to keep winning. No biggie, win small win frequently, and soon you'll be
on the track of tackling any challenge with an invincible attitude, and
you will actually score big wins.

When I first started out with Python, it was all too easy. I was so
super confident I can do anything with my dragon slayer. I of course
fell on face many times, again and again. They never felt like a battle
lost, they were small. Insignificant. But it did it's job in bringing
down my morale for a long time. No matter with how much enthusiasm I'd
start something, something in me always kept mocking me, "you'll fail",
and I did. It still haunts me sometime, but I've got over it pretty
well.
</p>

<p>
When you are just starting with something new, be little careful and
build a momentum with small wins, avoid losses howsoever small they
would be.
</p>

<p>
I don't mean don't start something challenging. Do whatever you want, be
prepared, you will hit walls. And when you do, remember not to
accumulate small losses, your mind is too stupid, fool it. For every
loss you suffer, score 3 wins. It doesn't matter how small they are,
just win something small, minute I'd say, it doesn't matter, just win.

<h2 id="small-habits">Small Habits</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-small-habits">
<p>
Habits are hard to build and leave. It's hard to get rid of bad ones,
it's even harder to build good ones.
</p>

<p>
I feel it to be very expensive to force myself out of (or into)
something new. It takes a huge chunk of my always limited will power,
leave me drained and exhausted. Leave me with too little energy to make
myself do anything else throughout the day.
</p>

<p>
Instead of building a big habit of doing regular exercise, I made some
small ones. Like eating some of my favorite snack bars every morning,
but only if I do 20 some push ups. It's working better than my previous
approach so far. I have raised the bar to 50 push ups in couple of
weeks. Yes its slow, but I win every morning, get to eat my favorite
snacks, and am building a healthy habit.
</p>

<p>
So the takeaway, instead of bringing a big change in your daily routine,
bring a small one, and if that too is too much for your puny self, bribe
yourself with a small reward.

<p>
Enough talk about stupid meaningless life, let's discus some real stuff
now.
</p>

<p>
Some small things can make you better at writing code.
</p>

<p>
Start with the smallest, most minimal version of your program, as
featureless as it can be without losing its meaning, and build it.
Software in some ways is like pottery, start small, iterate till you are
satisfied, and then bake it with intensive testing.
</p>

<p>
That's about tackling a problem, but how can you make your code better.
Well, make the smallest unit of your code clean and tidy. Now that
smallest unit can be whatever for you, I think of a file as the smallest
unit of my code. Start small, keep classes in their own files, keep the
file small and beautiful. At the end of the day, when you are about to
call your software "done", looking at each file of your app should fill
your eyes with tears of joy. It should be that beautiful.
</p>

<p>
And I can't emphasize it enough, keep your files small.
</p>

<h2 id="read-code-better">Read code better</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-read-code-better">
<p>
When I was just getting started with software, what would bother me a
lot was "how to read software". I struggled a lot with it, mostly
because I always took software too big for my mind back then.
</p>

<p>
Well, first of all, don't bite more than you can chew. Start with small
software, start with software you think you can write yourself and
increase the bar from there. Again, make several small wins before you
raise the bar for yourself.
</p>

<p>
If the software is written well enough, you'll find it very easy to
understand and pleasant to read. For example, I found meteor to be a
great read and very easy to understand. Just dive in, read the readmes,
big picture start revealing itself and soon you're reading a novel
written in Javascript.

<h2 id="small-annoyances">Small annoyances</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-small-annoyances">
<p>
And finally, small annoyances caused by the person sitting beside you
can make you wish the flight will crash and you'll get a chance to smack
his head into the running engine fan (or may be his feet first) before
you can finally die in peace
