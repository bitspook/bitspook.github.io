Spookfox is a Firefox extension and an Emacs package, which allow Emacs and
Firefox to communicate with each other. Its primary goal is to offer an Emacs
tinkerer similar (to Emacs) framework to tinker their browser.

I use Spookfox as my daily driver to enable a number of workflow enhancements,
e.g capturing articles I read and Youtube videos I watch.
