Life can be so overwhelming sometimes. Sometime I wonder how people go
on about living without asking questions. Or may be they do ask
questions but get satisfied by the answers world has to offer. So much
in the world goes around these questions after all. Religions and
nations for example. Who'd believe in such farcicality if there were
proper answers. Purposelessness is painful. So is loneliness. I seem to
have plenty of both of them. And then there is paranoia and laziness.
Latter two are mostly the reasons for former two. Inability to trust
anyone and jumping to the worst keep me away from most people. Laziness
keep me from diving into anything engaging enough to forget that it's
all meaningless.
</p>

<p>
Laziness now, may be I can do something about it. I have been practicing
with rituals as of late. They work well 60% of the time, today however I
failed them drastically. May be tomorrow will be a stronger day.
</p>

<p>
I think there is another reason for laziness as well. The work. It gets
so stupid some times. Well, most of the times it is so damn fucking
stupid. It is no fun writing forms all day long. But I need money right
now, I need a lot more than this job provides, but to start generating
more money, I need more skills. Whether I go for a better paying job or
for my own business, both need time. We're building a house, so the need
for money is immediate. I have to stick with this job for long enough to
finish the house and have some savings to give myself some period to lay
back and learn new skills, and bootstrap a business.
</p>

<p>
As to what business I'll do, I am thinking to have a take on content
publishing and app building combo. I'll build apps that do something,
and I'll start a blog for each app. Apps will have premium versions via
in-app purchases, and blogs will have ads. For this I plan to first
study the competition, for which I'll build an Intenet-wide crawler to
fetch and keep information about everything that goes on in public
Internet.
</p>

<p>
Another plan I have is to start an app and business for farming.
Bio-farming and whatnot. I like to farm and I like Punjab. I'll like to
do something for the land.
</p>

<p>
I have to get on speed with studying Haskell. I intend to start building
the Internet scanner in Haskell after I finish the 2 Haskell courses I
plan to do. After that I'll do a series of blogs for algorithms, apps,
games and Mathematics. Perhaps on farming and immigration out of India
as well. Basically everything that I want to do, I'll turn it into a
blog.
</p>

<p>
Sometime I want to just hit the road and live a traveler's life. I know
it sound obscene for I hate to travel, but constant change keep me from
falling into limbo, thinking how utterly meaningless everything is. I
guess that's how people go about their lives. There are so many problems
everyone have to deal with, there is no time or energy left to indulge
in this bullshit. Specially given that there is much more juicy bullshit
for most to indulge in; love, family, power, politics, nationality, and
the one bullshit to rule them all, religion.
