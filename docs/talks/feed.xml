            <title>Microservices</title>
            <link>https://bitspook.in/talks/microservices-techblend</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
I recently joined a Whatsapp group named &quot;Tech Blend&quot;, which conduct
weekly online meetups. Topic for last meetup was &quot;Microservices&quot;, for
which I volunteered. Since I was working for around 2 years on a
microservices based project of decent complexity, I thought it would be
fun to talk about my experience.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The meetup was fun. I ran out of time. The meetup is quite well managed.
Manpreet, the guy who organizes the meetup does a very good job
respecting everyone&apos;s time while managing to have meaningful discussions
at the same time. Their topics/talks are usually quite shallow, but this
event management is something I can learn from participating in this
group.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here are the slides for I created for the meetup. I was holding on to
them hoping I&apos;ll create a video, but that&apos;s not happening. So I am just
putting the slides over here.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Feel free to hit me up if you need some help regarding microservices, or
if you need me to explain some slide, or just for a chat.
&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Personal Brands for Software Developers (Talk)</title>
            <link>https://bitspook.in/talks/personal-brands-for-software-developers-talk</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
After long diligence, me and my old (Trantor) team decided to organize a meetup
to showcase our efforts, and to share our ideas with the local community. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/Chandigarh-Programmers-Club/events/263862634/&quot;&gt;The
meetup&lt;/a&gt; was organized in Trantor on September 18, 2019.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It was a collaborative talk given in 3 parts be me, Ayush Sharma, and
Sheenam Narula. Attendance was very low, but that&apos;s usually how it is in
Tricity. Overall it was a fun session with lengthy, and mostly fruitful
discussions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here&apos;s my set of slides from the talk:
&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Secure Software Teams Trantor</title>
            <link>https://bitspook.in/talks/secure-software-teams-trantor</link>
            <description>&lt;iframe src=&quot;//slides.com/bitspook/secure-software-teams/embed?style=light&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I gave this talk in one of internal sessions at Trantor. Goal was to
acquaint one of our software teams into the world of application
security. This was a basic talk, just to familiarize attendees with
basic information security concepts. I leveraged this opportunity to
propose setting up a Red Team in Trantor.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As practical part of this session, I created a docker based virtual lab
with webgoat set up. During the session we went through some of the
exercises, rest were left for the attendees as homework. Here&apos;s the
&lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt; file that was used in the session.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;example&quot; id=&quot;org1659083&quot;&gt;
version: &apos;3&apos;
services:
  webgoat:
    image: webgoat/webgoat-8.0
    environment:
      - WEBWOLF_HOST=webwolf
      - WEBWOLF_PORT=9090
    ports:
      - &quot;8080:8080&quot;
      - &quot;9001:9001&quot;
    volumes:
      - ./docker-volumes/webgoat-home:/home/webgoat/.webgoat
  webwolf:
    image: webgoat/webwolf
    ports:
      - &quot;9090:9090&quot;
    command: --spring.datasource.url=jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://webgoat:9001/webgoat --server.address=0.0.0.0
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To start the lab, simply create a directory, save above snippet as
&lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt;, and run &lt;code&gt;docker-compose up&lt;/code&gt; in it. You will then
be able to access webgoat on &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8080/WebGoat&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080/WebGoat&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
