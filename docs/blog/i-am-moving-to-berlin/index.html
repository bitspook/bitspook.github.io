<h2 id="org9f40b28">Why</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9f40b28">
<p>
There are several reasons I stated in my <a href="https://bitspook.in/blog/after-6-months-of-voluntary-unemployment/">previous blog post</a>. Other than those,
here are a few more:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Peer pressure
</p>

<p>
At this point it is customary for Punjabis to immigrate to a foreign country.
Since I was little I was conditioned to want to go to a developed country, so
it had become a deep rooted desire. My choice was of <b>which</b> country, and
going against the advice of almost everyone in my family, I chose to not go
to Canada or Australia. I was promised more money and easier life in those
countries, but I see more of my personal goals in alignment in Germany.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Cold weather
</p>

<p>
Punjab has colder weather than most parts of India, and they're my favorite
part of the year. I absolutely abhor Punjab's summers. Germany's cold weather
was appealing.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Europe
</p>

<p>
The fact that I get access to more than one country was also a factor. If I
still have the appetite, I can move to a different culture relatively easily.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Rules
</p>

<p>
I am a sucker for rules. If they are sensible and sensibly implemented, they
can free you up in so many ways. Many lines-of-thought can be short-circuited
and mental resources invested in more interesting things. Germany as far as I
have researched online have more sensible rules, and a culture of mostly
following them.

<h2 id="orga1f5c65">How I am feeling</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga1f5c65">
<p>
I am scared shitless. I am full of stress and anxiety, I can barely sleep and
can't focus on anything. I have stopped drinking coffee because I no longer need
caffeine for the jitters.
</p>

<p>
It is way more scarier than what I imagined. When I decided to move to Berlin I
was excited, a little scared too but also looking forward to it. Now I am
fighting myself to not just drop the whole thing every second of the day.
</p>

<p>
I am not an adventurous person, I find all forms of traveling tiresome. I stay
at home to recharge. Fear I am feeling right now however is more than the
ambiguity of going somewhere new. Me burning through my savings during past few
months is also a major contributor. I have made this huge decision, and spent
almost all my remaining funds to book housing, tickets and stuff.

<div id="outline-container-org86c9ad4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org86c9ad4">What lies ahead</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org86c9ad4">
<p>
I intend to come back to India after at most 2 years and at least 1 year.
</p>

<p>
1 year minimum because 1 year is the limit I am putting for myself to buckle up
and stay in Berlin, experience stuff even if I don't want to. I am hoping it'll
be enough to reveal whether my feeling that being outside my comfort zone will
make me do more fulfilling things is true or not. 2 year maximum because I think
2 years should be enough for personal growth by being in a foreign country.
</p>

<p>
I find the ideas of e-governance and using technology in public administration
most exciting. I think India is the right place to make most impact with these.
I want to establish a parallel social administration system, which can help the
State's system, or fight it to make a positive impact. This is also one of the
reasons I have decided to go work outside India. Because it is a significant
commitment and I don't want to find myself taking breaks from it for other
things I wanted to do which might significantly disrupt this commitment.
</p>

<p>
Or all this could just be fantasies. In almost every phase of life, whenever I
felt like things need to be improved I have fantasized about how things could
have been made better. At my home, in school, in college, in software companies,
in my village, in my city, in the companies I worked in; pretty much everywhere.
I have not always taken action, and often moved to the newer set of problems
forgetting the old ones as they became irrelevant to me. I won't fight it if it
happens this time as well. I can't fight every battle, I prefer letting the
fights pick themselves for me. But so far I am fully intent on returning to
India and participate somehow in public administration.
