I thought out hard last night and came up with a system that might (or
might not) work. But I have to keep trying till I get it right. Here are
some main points of my new system:
</p>
<div id="outline-container-commitment-1-commitment" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="commitment-1-commitment">#1 Commitment {#1-commitment}</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-commitment-1-commitment">
<p>
Do 8+ hours on day's priority #1 before you can open any other
website/video on the web. On weekdays it should be work that pay my
bills, on weekends it can be 2 things, study/side-kick-projects to try
new things/or whatever. I am free to just troll around on weekends, i.e
do nothing and waste the day. This is the only commitment I make for a
day.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-iterate-2-iterate" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="iterate-2-iterate">#2 Iterate {#2-iterate}</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-iterate-2-iterate">
<p>
Iterate over 3 days. Do above for 3 days, then review it and come up
with a list of things that were tempting me to divert from my plan. Then
replace these things with something else, or if possible get rid of
them. Improvise and bring changes in my system to remove all the
falsities. Also make a list of all the things that were motivating, and
keep bringing them back in the system with #3.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-change-3-change" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="change-3-change">#3 Change {#3-change}</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-change-3-change">
<p>
Bring something new in my workflow every 3 days. Start using some new
tool, make some modifications in Emacs.d, anything. If can't find
anything, spin something from good things I got from #2 and bring it in
the system with a flavour, or find a creative solution to get rid of
something bad from #2
</p>

</p>

<p>
It's not a perfect system, but aiming for perfection has brought nothing
but failure for me in past. I am trying to strike a balance b/w
practicality and flexibility in the system. i.e for a system that would
be flexible enough to improvise over time but strict enough that I won't
get lost in managing the system itself. Idea is that I am going to get
bored from this system in 15 days max. So before that happens, it should
become self-sustaining and would require minimum input, while giving
maximum satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
This is a system that should create another system when it dies in next
15 days, and same should happen after than. Only constant is change.
Keep improving, and more importantly, keep changing. Even if it is a
step in wrong direction once in a while, just change for the sake of
changing. If my system doesn't change, I will abandon it; so no matter
how much good it was, it's gonna get wasted. If it doesn't change that
is. Change is life baby!
</p>

<p>
By the way, today was the first day of me using this system. I
introduced Trello as a change to my workflow. I used to plan things in
org-mode in my Emacs, it's awesome. I changed to Trello just for the
sake of changing, and it worked wonders for one day at least. I believe
it can keep doing so for two more days. After that, I'll change
something else. Not necessarily my thought/todo management system, but
anything. I'll come back to Emacs' org-mode some time later. Constant
change doesn't mean things can't repeat. Future is what if not a
reincarnation of past.
</p>

<p>
I did more tasks than I planned for today. It feels good.
