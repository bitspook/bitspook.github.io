Working as a solo freelance developer, I used to have lofty ideas of how
a group of people can grow so much more together. I imagined how a mind
in the hive can grow at exponential rates. I made several attempts to
build communities striving for this, a few were successful to some
degree, most were not. Now working in a software development team at
<a href="http://trantorinc.com/">Trantor</a>, I am revisiting these ideas.
</p>

<p>
I still believe that it's a worthwhile general direction to move in. In
this post, I am asking myself (and you) the question of "how". How can
we maximize growth of an individual developer in a software team?
</p>

<p>
What do I mean by growth? Software is about so much more than just
writing code. It is also philosophy, psychology, mathematics, art and
policy making. Growth as a software developer encompass growth in all
these areas. Learning new tools and technologies is important, but so is
the conceptual knowledge of software development principles, foresight
about how decisions as trivial as naming a variable are going to impact
the future of our code, to perceiving the perception of reader of our
code, and also to make it elegant at many levels.
</p>

<p>
Why focus on an individual's growth? I believe people are selfish by
design. We think first for ourselves, then for our family, then for our
closest community, and so on. Growing individuals help teams (and
companies) directly as well. A culture of growth attracts good
developers, more good developers are good for teams/companies than
mediocre/bad ones. Optimizing for an individual's growth seem like a
good idea to me. I think it adds significant positive value to everyone
involved in the process of writing software.
</p>

<p>
Now then, how do we optimize for an individual's growth? I had a
discussion with the team here and we came up with some points that we
are going to try this
<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/sprints">sprint</a>. Plan is to
buckle up and finish our committed work a day earlier than planned. Then
on the extra day we earn, we sit back together, analyze two weeks of our
code, share peer feedback, and dig into one or more of following
activities.
</p>

<h2 id="interactive-sessions-of-new-tools-technologies">Interactive sessions of new tools/technologies</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-interactive-sessions-of-new-tools-technologies">
<p>
Topmost and shiniest layer of a software developer's growth is knowledge
of new tools and technologies. Some of us explore more technologies than
others. It was proposed that team members present a tool or technology,
and give an interactive session of something they find cool. This can be
very helpful for knowledge sharing in a diverse team where different
people might have very different roles. For example, I am also handling
the dev-ops in our current project, using tools like
<a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a>,
<a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>,
<a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> and
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>. But rest of the team has no
exposure to these tools. Me giving a session about these tools can be
very helpful for me, rest of the team, and the company. It is also very
much in alignment with my personal belief that every backend web
developer should be familiar with devops.
</p>

<p>
I differ from the proposal by the team a bit though. I think it is cool
to just "show and tell" bi-weekly, giving an interactive session is a
good to have.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-collaboratively-studying-open-source-projects-we-use">
<p>
Another very good suggestion was reading the source code of an open
source project, and collaboratively make notes of the patterns that
codebase has used, things they did right, things they did wrong etc. At
the end of the sprint, we can all discuss the notes we took, if we can
take something and use in our projects etc. We have picked chai.js for
this sprint.

<div id="outline-container-put-forward-new-approaches-in-forums" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="put-forward-new-approaches-in-forums">Put forward new approaches in forums</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-put-forward-new-approaches-in-forums">
<p>
Often times there are disagreements in team regarding approaches that
can be taken towards a problem. Or sometimes under the pressure of
delivery we pick one approach on another. If the taken approach is too
bad, a technical debt is created, but when it is "good enough", we just
move on. We don't want to let this slide. We should reconsider these
small improvements, and keep incrementally improving and challenging our
current practices.
</p>

<p>
We decided that we create posts on Trantor Forums for this, the team
should actively explore the alternative approaches, debate, reach a
consensus and implement the approach into our project. An example of
this is my proposal to bring <a href="https://stryker-mutator.io/">mutation
testing</a> to our workflow. I raised it, and then higher priorities sent
it so deep into the ground that I myself forgot about it. A forum post
can be a healthy reminder in such cases, provide documented discussion
and bring activity in our forums as well.

<div id="outline-container-day-long-hackathons" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="day-long-hackathons">Day long Hackathons</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-day-long-hackathons">
<p>
Another nice thing that came out of our discussion was that we can
utilize this extra day we earn ourselves as an internal team hackathon.
We can decide on any idea, regardless of its relevance for the
project/work, and the entire team spends a day hacking on it. Member
whose idea is selected can lead the team.
</p>

<p>
I think this can be a great way for team members to develop leadership
skills, learn new things, have some open-source portfolio, and most
importantly, feel that rush of starting a new project, and the bliss of
finishing one.
</p>

<p>
Above are few things we are going to start doing starting this sprint.
Please put in comments below if you have opinions and/or suggestions!
