You need to keep it. Don't rush, it's alright if you are not getting it.
Specially if you are from Python world. Javascript is to Python like
India is to New Zeland, things are not actually as complicated as they
appear, you just need to keep little patience.

Coffeescript helped me learn to think in javascript more than any book.
I am not saying that you should use coffeescript, but use it for
learning more about javascript. If you are unable to think something in
javascript, do a version of it in Coffeescript, generate javascript and
try to learn. I don't know how good is the generated javascript, but it
was good enough for me to not get stuck. Emacs helped me a lot in this.
I created a buffer with coffee-mode which was not visiting any file, and
compiled coffee to see javascript in a split window for comparison. It
really helped to avoid creating temporary files.

Books can do only so much to help you. Elequent Javascript is great (or
so they call it, actually I never got why it's called great), but what a
real project can teach you is on another level. Go out in wild and try
to do some real project, for fun of course.

<h2 id="avoid-dom-and-ui">Avoid DOM and UI</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-avoid-dom-and-ui">
<p>
DOM manipulation and Javascript have their own concepts which are most
times confusing to foreigners, specially if you are already infected by
JQuery. Make your aim to learn Javascript, as a programming language and
do something you do when learning a new language. Make self-contained
scripts which don't need browser to work. Of course browser help when
you are getting started and with 'console.log' you can avoid all sort of
DOM manipulation, but that's not what I mean. On the next step to
getting started, when you 'think' you know some javascript, try to make
something that involve as little DOM manipulation as possible. Try
making some simple nodeJs module, or some sort of browser extension.

It's better if you choose to do something you want to use, or at least
something you find really interesting. And focus on getting it done. All
ninja skills you want to learn come as a bonus. Remember those old
Jackie Chan movies in which kung-fu master make him do his household
chores? Just focus on washing clothes, you'll learn iron-fist style
without knowing it, as a bonus.
