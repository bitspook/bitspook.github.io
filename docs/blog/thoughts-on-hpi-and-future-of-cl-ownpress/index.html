Reflecting on similarities and differences b/w HPI and what I want cl-ownpress to build into.
Thinking out loud.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Recently I came across <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI">HPI</a> again. HPI has a lot of similarities to what I want cl-ownpress to be.
Its goal seem to be enabling a user to take ownership of their own data that's locked in online
platforms. This is exactly what I want cl-ownpress to do for me. This realization gave me pause, and
here I am rationalizing continued existence of cl-ownpress.
</p>

<p>
cl-ownpress is supposed to be a part of a bigger ecosystem for personal computing. By personal
computing I mean hooking into every aspect of my personal life. My thoughts (daily journal, captured
ideas), finances, things I own, people I interact with, work I do and everything else. In my ideal
personal computing ecosystem, different independent pieces interact with and build upon each other.
</p>

<p>
<i>For example</i>, I want to have a CRM to manage people and my relationships with them. I want the
ability to mention people from my CRM in my daily journal, and then be able to make queries like
"all interactions with person &lt;X&gt;". Similarly, I want to utilize my CRM to also mention people in my
blog-posts. These mentions however should get intelligently published. e.g on my personal website,
mention of a person should become a link to their own personal website. When publishing to mastodon,
it should become a mastodon mention.
</p>

<p>
<i>Another example</i>, I'd like to maintain an accounting ledger of all the money I spend. I want to
utilize this to also maintain a list of things I own. I'd like to utilize this in turn to review
things I use, and publish my reviews to my personal website and/or where I purchased it from.
</p>

<p>
Publishing a subset of all the data in my personal computing ecosystem is where cl-ownpress comes
in.
</p>

<p>
At present, cl-ownpress happens to be the most complete component of my ecosystem. I have a <a href="https://github.com/bitspook/brandi">few</a>
<a href="https://github.com/bitspook/saunf">other</a> <a href="https://github.com/bitspook/kharcha">pieces</a> in pretty-much abandoned state while I have replaced them with some untracked lisp code
(mostly in my Emacs setup).
</p>

<p>
HPI seems to provide same functionality as cl-ownpress's <a href="https://github.com/bitspook/cl-ownpress/blob/master/src/provider/package.lisp#L1-L4">providers</a>. So why not replace <code>provider</code>-s
with HPI and build on already done work? Well, things I wanted so far (converting my denote notes to
blog posts while using my Emacs configuration to do the conversion from org to html) don't have a
replacement in HPI. In future, when I want to deal with an external data source and there is an HPI
module available for it, perhaps I'll create an <code>hpi-provider</code>.
</p>

<p>
That settles one aspect of relationship of cl-ownpress and HPI. They're complimentary instead of
contradictory. HPI is essentially a set of cl-ownpress <code>provider</code>-s. But I believe there is a
philosophical difference in how both these projects approach gaining ownership over user's data.
</p>

<p>
HPI <b>accepts</b> that data is going to be produced on walled platforms, while cl-ownpress establishes
user's own platform where data is originally published. Cl-ownpress then uses the walled platforms
for interacting with people these platforms have managed to hold hostage.
</p>

<p>
Admittedly HPI has a broader scope, it deals with more than just getting data back from walled
platforms, but in the aspect of 'publishing', I believe this holds true. With cl-ownpress, I want to
invert the relationship. Instead of "the platform &lt;X&gt; uses me and locks in <b>my</b> content", I want it
to be "<b>I</b> own my content, and use the walled garden to interact with its hostages".
</p>

<p>
The subtle difference is important to me. This is an attitude I'd like to have towards life, and
what is my personal computing ecosystem if not its reflection.
